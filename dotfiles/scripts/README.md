# Scripts

## Purpose

- Some convenient shell scripts

## Usage

- Source [colors_define.sh](./colors_define.sh) in your shell (otherwise some scripts might not work as they expect colors to be defined)
- Export `KEMA_SCRIPTS_DIR_PUBLIC="/path/to/this/directory"` in your shell (otherwise some scripts might not work as they expect this variable to be defined)
- Run any of the scripts in this directory
